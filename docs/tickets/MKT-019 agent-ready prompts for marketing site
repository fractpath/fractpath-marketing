Ticket ID

MKT-019

Title

Agent-ready execution prompts for FractPath marketing site (Next.js + calculator + lead capture)

Objective

Create a set of frozen, copy-pasteable prompts and task bundles that allow AI agents (Replit, Claude Code, Copilot) to:

build the FractPath marketing site end-to-end

follow the approved narrative, design system, and legal posture

avoid scope creep into app functionality

generate production-quality front-end code without manual assembly

This ticket exists to eliminate hand-building and intent drift.

Non-goals

No backend deal logic

No auth flows

No app dashboard components

No Stripe, Supabase, or messaging

No investor deck generation

Agent Contract (critical)

Every agent prompt must include:

“You are working inside the fractpath-marketing repository.
You must not introduce application logic, authentication, or backend APIs.
You must adhere strictly to the frozen specifications referenced below.”

This prevents agents from “helpfully” overbuilding.

Canonical references agents must use

Agents must treat these as authoritative:

docs/marketing/website-copy/* (from MKT-018)

docs/marketing/beta-positioning.md

docs/marketing/founder-narrative.md

Design system constraints:

shadcn/ui

Tailwind

dark mode

cyan accent (WCAG AA)

CTAs:

Primary → scroll to calculator

Secondary → scroll to How It Works

Signup link → https://app.fractpath.com/signup

A) Master agent prompt (use this first)

Create:

docs/marketing/agent-prompts/master-prompt.md


Prompt content (paste-ready):

You are an AI frontend engineer building the FractPath public marketing site.

Constraints:

Framework: Next.js (App Router)

Styling: Tailwind + shadcn/ui

Dark mode required

Accent color: Cyan (WCAG AA compliant)

No backend logic

No authentication

No app features

You must follow:

FractPath founder narrative

Website copy documents

Legal posture: illustrative, non-binding

The site must include:

Hero

Calculator section

How It Works

Persona benefits

Trust section

CTA

Do not invent product features.
Ask clarifying questions only if absolutely required.

B) Ticket-mapped agent task bundles

Create one prompt per major section, mapped to existing MKT tickets.

1) Marketing shell + layout (MKT-001 / MKT-007)
docs/marketing/agent-prompts/site-shell.md


Agent instructions:

Create Next.js app structure

Global layout

Header with logo (left) + “Join beta” (right)

Footer with legal microcopy

Dark mode toggle

2) Hero + narrative sections (MKT-018)
docs/marketing/agent-prompts/hero-and-narrative.md


Agent instructions:

Implement hero copy exactly

Proper spacing and typography

CTA scroll behavior

Legal microcopy placement

3) Calculator embed + visualization container (MKT-003 / MKT-005)
docs/marketing/agent-prompts/calculator-section.md


Agent instructions:

Create calculator container

Embed script-injected React widget

Persona toggle UI (UI only)

Space reserved for charts

Gated output messaging (email reveal copy only)

⚠️ Explicitly state:

Do not implement calculator logic — only embed and present.

4) Personas + benefits (MKT-004 / MKT-008)
docs/marketing/agent-prompts/personas.md


Agent instructions:

Three persona sections

Neutral tone

Benefit-driven copy

No pricing or promises

5) Analytics + lead capture wiring (MKT-006)
docs/marketing/agent-prompts/analytics-and-leads.md


Agent instructions:

Plausible script integration

HubSpot form embedding

Persona tagging fields

No cookies beyond analytics

C) Guardrails agents must respect

Include in every prompt:

❌ No “returns”

❌ No “investment advice”

❌ No “offers”

❌ No “guarantees”

❌ No backend APIs

❌ No app routes

Violation = discard output.

D) How you actually run this (practical workflow)

Copy master prompt into Replit / Claude Code

Paste one agent-prompt file at a time

Review output

Commit after each section

Never let an agent touch app logic

This keeps builds composable and debuggable.

Acceptance Criteria (Definition of Done)

Marketing site can be built end-to-end via agent prompts

No intent drift across sections

No accidental app functionality

Copy exactly matches approved narrative

UI is investor-presentable
