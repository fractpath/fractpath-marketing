Ticket ID

MKT-017

Title

Founder narrative, pitch scaffold, and repeatable storytelling assets

Objective

Create a single, coherent founder story and a modular pitch scaffold that:

explains FractPath clearly in under 60 seconds

frames the problem in human, not financial, terms

differentiates from loans, HELOCs, and shared-equity incumbents

aligns with your legal posture (facilitator, not lender)

scales from casual intro → partner pitch → investor meeting

This is narrative infrastructure, not a polished deck (yet).

Non-goals

No financial projections

No TAM/SAM/SOM modeling

No hard fundraising ask language

No public-facing manifesto

Core Design Principles

Human first, financial second

Clarity over cleverness

Credible, not hype-driven

Repeatable across audiences

Consistent with product reality

Implementation Requirements
A) Founder origin story (short + long)

Create:

docs/marketing/founder-narrative.md


Include two versions:

1) 30-second version (default)

Structure:

Personal observation

Why current options fail

What FractPath unlocks

Why now

Template:

“I kept seeing homeowners forced into debt just to access their own equity, and buyers locked out of ownership by upfront costs. FractPath lets private parties share equity instead of creating more debt—structured, transparent, and recorded. It’s not a loan; it’s a different path to ownership.”

2) 2-minute version (partner/investor)

Expand with:

Market context

Why incumbents won’t solve this

Why you’re building it now

B) Problem framing (1 slide / 60 seconds)

Create:

docs/marketing/problem-framing.md


Key points:

Home equity is illiquid unless you borrow

Buyers face capital barriers even when monthly cash flow exists

Traditional finance forces debt where flexibility is needed

Avoid:

“Banks are evil”

Regulatory antagonism

Tone:

Calm, structural, inevitable

C) Solution framing (what FractPath actually is)

Create:

docs/marketing/solution-framing.md


Explain:

Shared equity, not debt

Private-party agreements

Structured terms + recorded lifecycle

Title-backed security

Platform as facilitator + record keeper

One-liner:

“FractPath turns home equity into a structured, shareable asset—without creating debt.”

D) Differentiation scaffold (vs alternatives)

Create:

docs/marketing/differentiation.md


Compare against:

HELOCs / cash-out refis

Home equity investment companies

Rent-to-own

Fractional rental investing

Dimensions:

Debt vs equity

Control

Flexibility

Transparency

Alignment of incentives

E) Why now (timing narrative)

Create:

docs/marketing/why-now.md


Cover:

Rate environment

Housing affordability

Consumer discomfort with leverage

Technology enabling structured private agreements

Regulatory pressure on traditional products

Avoid:

Macro doom language

F) Business model explanation (clean + legal-safe)

Create:

docs/marketing/business-model.md


Explain:

Platform fees

Exit fees

Realtor referrals

Optional services

Be explicit:

No interest

No APR

No spread lending

G) Traction & proof (beta-friendly)

Create:

docs/marketing/traction-proof.md


What counts as traction:

Scenarios modeled

Deals initiated

Title partner interest

Beta users onboarded

Case studies in progress

Use phrases like:

“Early signals”

“Beta learnings”

“Proof of demand”

H) Pitch scaffold (modular outline)

Create:

docs/marketing/pitch-scaffold.md


Sections (each optional):

Opening (problem)

Personal story

Solution

How it works

Why it’s different

Why now

Early traction

Where this goes

Ask (if appropriate)

This lets you tailor to:

investor

title partner

realtor

advisor

I) Objection handling (pre-written)

Create:

docs/marketing/objections.md


Include responses to:

“Isn’t this just a loan?”

“Is this regulated?”

“Why wouldn’t Zillow do this?”

“What happens if prices fall?”

“Why would a buyer accept illiquidity?”

Answers should be:

calm

factual

aligned with product truth

Acceptance Criteria (Definition of Done)

Founder story exists (short + long)

Problem and solution clearly framed

Differentiation documented

Business model explained safely

Pitch scaffold reusable

Objection responses ready

Language aligns with legal posture

No promises of returns
