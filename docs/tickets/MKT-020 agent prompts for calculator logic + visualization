MKT-020

Title

Agent-ready prompts for calculator logic, scenario math, and data visualization (marketing-safe)

Objective

Create precise, constrained agent prompts that enable AI tools to build the marketing calculator logic and visuals such that:

the math is consistent with your term sheet model

outputs are illustrative and non-binding

personas see tailored value framing

floors, ceilings, and timing incentives are visible (but simplified)

visuals are modern, minimal, and investor-presentable

no app logic, deal creation, or persistence is introduced

This calculator is a teaching + conversion tool, not the contract engine.

Non-goals

No deal persistence

No user accounts

No negotiation logic

No payments

No AVM calls

No contract generation

No backend APIs

Canonical references (agents must treat as truth)

Agents must adhere to:

docs/marketing/website-copy/calculator.md

Term model concepts from:

Floors (FM)

Ceilings (CM)

Timing factor (early / standard / late)

Persona framing rules from MKT-018

Legal guardrails from OPS-003 / OPS-004

Design system:

shadcn/ui

Tailwind

Dark mode

Cyan accent (AA compliant)

Calculator scope (locked)
Inputs (fixed defaults, editable)

Property value (SV)

Upfront contribution

Monthly contribution

Horizon (years)

Rules:

Inputs show $ and commas

Internal values remain numeric

Defaults are clearly referenced in outputs

No “advanced inputs” on marketing site.

Core derived values (marketing-safe)

Agents may compute:

Total capital contributed

Estimated equity share (simplified)

Estimated future property value (modeled appreciation)

Buyer implied purchase price

Homeowner remaining equity

Illustrative exit outcomes:

Early

Standard

Late

Agents must not compute:

IRR

APR

Yield

Investment returns phrasing

Visualization requirements
Required visuals

Equity split visualization

Buyer vs Homeowner

Donut or stacked bar

Labeled as “illustrative”

Value over time

Simple line chart

Current → horizon

No real-time pricing

Exit scenario comparison

Three-column comparison

Early / Standard / Late

Shows:

Buyer payout range

Homeowner net range

Floor / ceiling badges

Persona-specific framing (copy-level only)
Buyer view

Emphasize:

Path to ownership

Equity accumulation

Implied purchase price vs future value

De-emphasize:

Fees

Platform mechanics

Homeowner view

Emphasize:

Cash unlocked

Remaining equity

No new debt

De-emphasize:

Buyer upside framing

Realtor view

Emphasize:

New deal path

Expanded solution set

Participation opportunity

De-emphasize:

Financial math details

Agents must implement copy swaps only, not different math.

A) Master calculator agent prompt

Create:

docs/marketing/agent-prompts/calculator-master.md


Paste-ready prompt:

You are building a marketing calculator for FractPath.

Constraints:

This calculator is illustrative only.

It must not resemble a loan calculator.

It must not show investment returns or yields.

All outputs must be labeled “Estimated” or “Illustrative.”

Inputs:

Property value

Upfront contribution

Monthly contribution

Horizon (years)

Outputs:

Estimated equity split

Estimated value over time

Early / standard / late exit comparison

Design:

Minimal

Modern

shadcn/ui + Tailwind

Dark mode

Cyan accent

You must not add backend logic, persistence, or authentication.
Ask clarifying questions only if absolutely necessary.

B) Math logic prompt (explicit but simplified)

Create:

docs/marketing/agent-prompts/calculator-math.md


Agent instructions:

Use simple proportional math

Assume linear accumulation of equity

Apply:

Floor protection (minimum outcome)

Ceiling cap (maximum outcome)

Timing factor modifies payout, not FMV

Clearly annotate where floors/ceilings apply

Required labels:

“Floor protection applied”

“Ceiling cap applied”

“Timing affects payout, not home value”

C) Visualization prompt

Create:

docs/marketing/agent-prompts/calculator-visuals.md


Agent instructions:

Use lightweight chart library (Recharts or equivalent)

Ensure:

Readability on mobile

Tooltips explain terms in plain language

No financial jargon

D) Persona framing prompt

Create:

docs/marketing/agent-prompts/calculator-personas.md


Agent instructions:

Toggle persona labels only

Swap explanatory text

Keep math identical

Never change outputs per persona

E) Gating + CTA prompt

Create:

docs/marketing/agent-prompts/calculator-gating.md


Agent instructions:

Require email to reveal full outputs

Capture persona + summary values

CTA after reveal:

“Build and negotiate these terms inside the app”

Link to:
https://app.fractpath.com/signup

Guardrails (repeat in every prompt)

Agents must not:

Mention ROI or returns

Mention interest rates

Use loan terminology

Suggest guarantees

Add backend logic

Violation = discard output.

Acceptance Criteria (Definition of Done)

Calculator math aligns with term concepts

Visuals are clean and professional

Personas are clearly addressed

Legal posture is preserved

Calculator can be built entirely via agent prompts

Output is demo-safe for investors and partners
