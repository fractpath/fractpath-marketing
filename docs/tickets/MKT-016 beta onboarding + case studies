TICKET MKT-016 — Beta onboarding + case studies
Ticket ID

MKT-016

Title

Beta onboarding flows, early proof points, and case study scaffolding

Objective

Design a controlled beta onboarding system that:

converts marketing leads into qualified beta users

sets clear expectations (what beta is / is not)

captures structured proof points from early deals

produces investor- and partner-ready case studies

avoids operational overload

This is about process + narrative, not heavy automation.

Non-goals

No public testimonials yet

No performance guarantees

No anonymized public deal marketplace

No SEO content engine

No referral virality loops

Preconditions

Marketing site live (fractpath.com)

Calculator + persona toggles exist

HubSpot integrated for lead capture

APP-001 → APP-013 roadmap in place

OPS-003 + OPS-004 complete

Core Design Principles

Beta is selective, not open

Every beta user is a potential case study

Clarity beats persuasion

Proof over polish

Manual is acceptable if structured

Implementation Requirements
A) Beta positioning (copy + framing)

Create a clear beta narrative used consistently across site, email, and portal:

Key points:

“Limited beta”

“Structured equity agreements”

“Manual + guided in early phase”

“Shaping the platform together”

Required copy blocks:

What beta includes

What beta does not include

How selection works

Why early access matters

Create doc:

docs/marketing/beta-positioning.md

B) Beta intake funnel (simple, gated)
1) Public CTA (marketing site)

Buttons:

“Join Buyer Beta”

“Join Homeowner Beta”

“Join Realtor Beta”

All lead to:

Short gated form (email required)

Persona-specific follow-up questions

2) Persona-specific intake questions

Buyer

Target property location

Timeline to ownership

Approximate budget range

Willingness to participate in case study (yes/no)

Homeowner

Property location

Reason for liquidity

Desired cash range

Comfort with shared equity concept (scale)

Willingness to participate in case study

Realtor

License state

Years active

Typical deal size

Interest in beta referral program

Capture in HubSpot properties.

C) Beta acceptance flow (manual but clear)

Once reviewed (you manually):

Send “Beta Accepted” email

Include:

What happens next

Link to portal signup

Clear disclaimers

Expectation of manual steps

Create templates:

docs/marketing/beta-email-templates.md


Include:

Accepted

Waitlisted

Not a fit (polite, future-oriented)

D) Beta onboarding inside the app

First-login experience:

Welcome screen

“What beta means” checklist

Next steps CTA:

Create scenario

Invite counterparty

Contact support

Avoid feature overload.

E) Case study data capture (quiet but systematic)

Create a Case Study Capture Checklist for each beta deal:

docs/marketing/case-study-capture.md


Capture:

Persona (buyer/homeowner/realtor)

Starting situation

Problem being solved

Terms summary (sanitized)

Timeline milestones

Outcome (even if partial)

Quotes (optional, anonymized)

Do not promise publication—get consent later.

F) Case study formats (lightweight)

Prepare 3 formats:

Internal learning brief

Full detail

Used for product improvement

Partner-facing summary

1–2 pages

No identifying info

Used with title firms, investors

Public anonymized vignette (future)

Short narrative

“How it worked” focus

No numbers unless approved

Document structure:

docs/marketing/case-study-formats.md

G) Investor preview integration

On marketing site:

“Investor preview” section

Show:

Aggregated stats (e.g., “X scenarios modeled”)

Hypothetical example (clearly labeled)

Early beta participation count

No real returns shown yet.

H) Metrics to track during beta

Track manually or via admin analytics:

Beta signups by persona

Accepted vs waitlisted

Deals initiated

Deals progressing to contract

Time-to-first-value

Document:

docs/marketing/beta-metrics.md
