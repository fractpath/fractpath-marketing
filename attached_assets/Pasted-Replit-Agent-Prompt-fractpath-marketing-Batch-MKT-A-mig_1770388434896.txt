Replit Agent Prompt — fractpath-marketing (Batch MKT-A: migration docs + ticket hygiene)

You are my engineering agent for the fractpath-marketing repo.

Goal (SAFE BATCH MKT-A)

Do ticket hygiene + migration documentation only so the widget repo is the declared calculator source of truth.
No runtime code changes.

Hard constraints

Do NOT implement or modify any calculator logic in marketing.

Do NOT embed the widget yet.

Do NOT touch /api/lead yet (that’s MKT-B).

Only edit markdown/docs/tickets (and optionally a single README line).

Tasks

Create a migration doc:

File: docs/migration/calculator-widget.md

Content must include:

Boundary: widget repo owns deterministic math, chart series, calc UI, gating; marketing owns page copy, /api/lead HubSpot upsert, analytics wiring, wrapper parsing of query params.

Source of truth statement: “Marketing must not contain calculator math. Widget is canonical.”

Mapping table: MKT → WGT mapping:

MKT-005 → WGT-010 + WGT-011 (moved)

MKT-012 → WGT-020 (moved)

MKT-004 → split: UI/gating in widget (WGT-030/WGT-031); marketing keeps wrapper/layout

MKT-006 → split: widget builds payload (WGT-031); marketing does server route /api/lead

MKT-011 → split: widget emits events; marketing logs them

Implementation plan: short 5–7 bullet steps describing how marketing will embed later (MKT-C), but explicitly “not in this batch”.

Update existing marketing ticket markdown files to reflect status:

For each relevant MKT ticket file, add a top “Status” line:

Status: MOVED → fractpath-calculator-widget (WGT-xxx)

or Status: SPLIT → see WGT-xxx + remaining marketing work

Add a short “Notes” section with the new source of truth and links/refs.

Add a small index note:

Either docs/tickets/README.md or docs/README.md (wherever ticket process is documented)

Add a short “Calculator source of truth: widget repo” paragraph.

Acceptance criteria

 Only docs/tickets markdown changed (no TS/JS/Next runtime code touched)

 Migration doc clearly defines boundaries and ticket mapping

 Tickets updated with MOVED/SPLIT status and references

 Repo passes whatever baseline check exists (if none, at least git status clean after commit)

Process

Create a new branch: mkt-migration-calculator-widget

Implement tasks above

git status -sb and show changed files list

Commit message: docs(migration): declare widget as calculator source of truth

Push branch to origin and stop

Stop after pushing.
