Title

Public website copy system grounded in founder narrative (conversion + credibility)

Objective

Refine all public-facing website copy so it:

reflects the founder narrative consistently

explains the product in plain language

speaks to multiple personas without fragmenting the page

reinforces trust and legal posture

supports the calculator as the primary engagement driver

This is a copy system, not just headline tweaks.

No legal document drafting
