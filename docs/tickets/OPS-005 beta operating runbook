TICKET OPS-005 — Beta operating runbook (day-to-day execution)
Ticket ID

OPS-005

Title

Beta operating runbook: daily workflows, escalation paths, and manual ops

Objective

Create a single, practical runbook that enables you to operate FractPath’s beta confidently and consistently by:

standardizing daily/weekly workflows

defining how leads, deals, payments, and partners are handled

preventing missed follow-ups or compliance gaps

reducing cognitive load for a solo founder

making it easy to onboard future help (ops, legal, sales)

This is the source of truth for “how beta actually runs.”

Non-goals

No automation-heavy SOPs

No staffing plan

No SLAs beyond simple expectations

No enterprise compliance playbooks

Preconditions

MKT-016 (beta onboarding) complete

OPS-003 and OPS-004 complete

APP-001 → APP-013 roadmap in place

You are operating as a solo founder

Core Operating Principles

Manual is fine if it’s predictable

Nothing lives only in your head

Every deal has a clear “next action”

Escalate early, don’t improvise late

Clarity > speed > automation

Implementation Requirements
A) Daily operating checklist

Create:

docs/ops/runbook/daily-checklist.md


Include a short, repeatable list:

Every day (15–30 min):

Check new beta signups (HubSpot)

Review admin analytics “Needs attention”

Respond to support inbox

Review deal status changes

Log any off-platform actions in deal notes

B) Weekly operating cadence

Create:

docs/ops/runbook/weekly-checklist.md


Once per week:

Review deal funnel metrics

Identify stalled deals

Follow up with title partner(s)

Review payment ledger for due items

Update beta metrics

Capture early learnings (what confused users?)

C) Lead → deal operating flow

Create:

docs/ops/runbook/lead-to-deal-flow.md


Step-by-step:

Lead captured (persona tagged)

You review fit

Accept / waitlist email sent

User signs up to portal

Scenario created

Counterparty invited

Deal status updated

Notes logged

Include:

Where decisions are manual

Where data must be logged

D) Deal lifecycle states & actions

Create:

docs/ops/runbook/deal-lifecycle.md


For each state:

What it means

What you should do

What should happen next

When to escalate

Example states:

DRAFT

INVITED

CONNECTED

TERMS_SHAPING

PRE_CONTRACT

CONTRACTED_MANUAL

ACTIVE

EXITED

E) Payment handling (MVP)

Create:

docs/ops/runbook/payments.md


Cover:

When payments are collected

How Stripe events are monitored

How failed payments are handled

When manual follow-up is required

How to log waivers or exceptions

Explicitly document:

No funds held in escrow by FractPath

Payment disputes escalation path

F) Title partner coordination (Maryland-first)

Create:

docs/ops/runbook/title-partner-coordination.md


Include:

When Eagle Title is contacted

What packet is sent

What FractPath provides vs partner provides

How status updates are recorded

Who communicates with homeowner/buyer

This doc is also onboarding material for partners.

G) Support & escalation playbook

Create:

docs/ops/runbook/support-escalation.md


Define:

Common questions (pricing, timing, legality)

Response templates

When to escalate to:

legal counsel

title partner

Incident logging

H) Change management & term updates

Create:

docs/ops/runbook/change-management.md


Rules:

When terms can be revised

How new versions are created

How users are notified

How acceptance is logged

Avoid:

silent changes

off-platform renegotiation

I) Beta boundaries & “no” list

Create:

docs/ops/runbook/beta-boundaries.md


Explicitly state:

What beta does not support

Requests you will defer

How to say “not yet” politely

This protects your time and credibility.

Acceptance Criteria (Definition of Done)

Daily and weekly checklists exist

Lead-to-deal flow documented

Deal states clearly defined

Payment handling documented

Title coordination flow documented

Support escalation paths defined

Change management rules exist

Beta boundaries documented

QA Checklist

 Could someone else run beta for a week using this?

 Are all manual steps logged somewhere?

 Are escalation paths clear?

 Are users treated consistently?

 Is legal posture protected?

If yes → this runbook is doing its job.
