OPS-004

Title

Legal readiness checklist: Maryland-first launch with national scale guardrails

Objective

Create a clear, defensible legal posture for FractPath’s MVP that:

supports Maryland-first operations

avoids triggering lender/broker licensing unintentionally

aligns product language, workflows, and contracts with stated positioning

prepares you to onboard a title partner (e.g., Eagle Title of Annapolis)

establishes a repeatable path to multi-state expansion

This ticket is process + documentation, not code.

Non-goals

No full 50-state legal analysis

No SEC/FINRA registration strategy

No bespoke contract drafting engine

No escrow trust account setup

No legal advice substitution (attorney still required)

Preconditions

OPS-001, OPS-003 complete

APP-001 → APP-013 planned or implemented

Maryland is the initial operating state

FractPath positioned as facilitator / record keeper, not lender

Core Legal Positioning (anchor)

FractPath facilitates and records shared-equity agreements between private parties.
FractPath does not:

extend credit

set interest rates

underwrite borrowers

provide legal advice

act as a title company or escrow agent

Every checklist item below reinforces this.

Implementation Requirements
A) Entity & authority check (Maryland)

Create:

docs/ops/legal/entity-and-authority.md


Checklist:

 FractPath entity is properly registered (MD)

 Operating agreement reflects facilitation/record-keeping role

 Website footer includes legal entity name + state

 Terms of Service name FractPath as platform provider only

Outcome: You can answer “Who are you legally?” cleanly.

B) Licensing risk review (what you are not)

Create:

docs/ops/legal/licensing-risk-matrix.md


Table with columns:

Activity

Could this trigger a license?

FractPath behavior

Mitigation

Cover at least:

Lending / credit extension

Mortgage brokerage

Investment advisory

Real estate brokerage

Escrow / settlement services

Example:

Mortgage lending → risk if interest charged

FractPath behavior: equity transfer, no interest, no repayment schedule

Mitigation: avoid “loan” language everywhere

Outcome: Clear internal guardrails.

C) Contract role clarity (who does what)

Create:

docs/ops/legal/role-clarity.md


Explicitly define:

Homeowner

Buyer (utilizer)

Realtor (referrer/co-pilot)

Title company

FractPath

Include:

What FractPath does

What FractPath does not do

Who owns each legal step (title search, lien recording, closing)

This document is what you show:

title partners

skeptical attorneys

early investors

D) Required disclaimers inventory

Create:

docs/ops/legal/disclaimers.md


List exact locations where disclaimers must appear:

Marketing calculator outputs

Scenario pages

Negotiation UI

Contract packets

Emails referencing terms

Standard language blocks:

“Illustrative, non-binding”

“Not legal or financial advice”

“Final terms governed by executed agreement”

“Valuation estimates only”

Outcome: No accidental promises.

E) Maryland title + lien flow (MVP)

Create:

docs/ops/legal/maryland-title-flow.md


Document:

When title partner is engaged

Who orders title search

How lien is recorded

How payoff waterfall is enforced at exit

Include:

Where FractPath hands off

Where FractPath steps back

This is critical for Eagle Title conversations.

F) Realtor compliance posture (Maryland)

Create:

docs/ops/legal/realtor-compliance.md


Clarify:

Realtors are referrers/co-pilots

No pricing advice or underwriting

Commission structure is disclosed

Realtor dashboard is informational

Add:

How you’ll avoid “brokerage of financing” issues

How referral fees are framed

G) Payments & fee compliance sanity check

Create:

docs/ops/legal/fees-and-payments.md


Cover:

Platform fees (what they are for)

Exit fee (fee at payout, not interest)

Realtor commissions

Partner fees

Explicitly state:

No interest

No APR

No amortization schedule

H) Expansion readiness checklist (non-MD)

Create:

docs/ops/legal/expansion-checklist.md


Before entering a new state:

 Confirm shared-equity treatment

 Confirm title recording differences

 Update disclaimers if needed

 Identify local title partner

 Validate referral fee permissibility

This avoids “oops” expansion.

I) Attorney engagement brief (fast + cheap)

Create:

docs/ops/legal/attorney-brief.md


One-page summary you send to a Maryland attorney:

What FractPath does

What it does not do

Sample term sheet

Sample contract packet

Specific questions you want answered

Goal: 2–3 hour review, not months of billable time.

Acceptance Criteria (Definition of Done)

Legal posture documents exist and are consistent

Product language aligns with legal positioning

You can explain FractPath to a title attorney confidently

You can answer licensing questions without hesitation

Maryland launch risks are understood and mitigated

Expansion path is documented (even if not executed)

QA Checklist (self-test)

 Can I explain this to Eagle Title in 10 minutes?

 Does anything look like a loan?

 Does anything look like investment advice?

 Are fees clearly platform/service-based?

 Are final legal steps owned by partners, not FractPath?

If yes → you are legally MVP-ready.
